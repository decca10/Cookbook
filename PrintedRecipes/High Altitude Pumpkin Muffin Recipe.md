High Altitude Pumpkin Muffin Recipe

Ingredients:
- 1 3/4 cups all-purpose flour
- 1 teaspoon baking powder
- 1/2 teaspoon baking soda
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
- 1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg
- 1/4 teaspoon ground cloves
- 1/2 cup unsalted butter, melted
- 1 cup granulated sugar
- 1/2 cup packed light brown sugar
- 2 large eggs
- 1 cup canned pumpkin puree
- 1/4 cup milk
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract

Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C). Line a muffin tin with paper liners.
2. In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt, cinnamon, nutmeg, and cloves.
3. In a large bowl, whisk together the melted butter, granulated sugar, and brown sugar until well combined.
4. Add the eggs one at a time, whisking well after each addition. Stir in the pumpkin puree, milk, and vanilla extract.
5. Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, stirring until just combined. Do not overmix.
6. Divide the batter evenly among the muffin cups, filling each about 2/3 full.
7. Bake for 18-20 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of a muffin comes out clean.
8. Remove from the oven and let the muffins cool in the tin for 5 minutes. Then transfer them to a wire rack to cool completely.
