Apple Crisp
Ingredients:
- 6 cups sliced apples
- 1 cup granulated sugar
- 1 tablespoon all-purpose flour
- 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
- 1/2 cup all-purpose flour
- 1/2 cup old-fashioned oats
- 1/2 cup packed light brown sugar
- 1/4 teaspoon baking powder
- 1/4 teaspoon baking soda
- 1/4 cup unsalted butter, cold and cubed

Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease a 9x9-inch baking dish.
2. In a large bowl, combine the sliced apples, granulated sugar, 1 tablespoon flour, and cinnamon. Toss until the apples are evenly coated. Transfer the mixture to the prepared baking dish.
3. In a separate bowl, combine 1/2 cup flour, oats, brown sugar, baking powder, and baking soda. Cut in the cold butter using a pastry cutter or your fingers until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs.
4. Sprinkle the crumb mixture evenly over the apples in the baking dish.
5. Bake for 40-45 minutes, or until the topping is golden brown and the apples are tender.
6. Remove from the oven and let it cool for a few minutes before serving.

Notes:
This apple crisp is best served warm with a scoop of vanilla ice cream on top.
